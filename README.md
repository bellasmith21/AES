# AES

This project takes in a string of text and encrypts it using the American Encryption Standard, also known as Rijndael.

## Explanation

AES is a symmetric block cipher encryption chosen by the United States government to encrypt stuff in a competition from 1997 to 2000.  Two Belgian mathematicians Joan Daemen and Vincent developed Rijmen, and it is used all across the web today.  This program uses a 128 bit key, the least secure of the three, but still incredibly secure.
